The business itself has a fatal combination of unpredictable cash flows, weak moat characteristics, and astronomical valuation - a perfect storm of investment risk.</p>

The risk-reward profile appears unfavorable for long-term investors.</p>

                                <p>The automobile business has been a capital intensive, low-margin industry for over a century. While Tesla has innovative technology, at these prices, you're not buying a business - you're buying a hope and a dream. Charlie and I have always believed that price is what you pay, value is what you get. Here, you're paying an extraordinary price for rather ordinary economics. Remember what we did with the textile mills at Berkshire? Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to walk away from an exciting story when the numbers don't add up. This is one of those times.</p>
